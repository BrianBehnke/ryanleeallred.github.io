Standard Deviation is a statistical measure that is used to define the spread of a data set. It shows how variable the data in a set is. It is typically calculated using a sample of the population in order to define the entire population. 

When the Standard Deviation is small, relative to the mean, it shows that the data points are not very spread out. This also indicates that each point is a good measure of the average of the data set. If you take any one point from the data set you will be fairly certain that this data point is an accurate measure of the average of the whole data set.

When the Standard Deviation is large, it means that there is a greater spread of the data points. A large Standard Deviation indicates that each point is a poor measure of the average of the data set. So if you take any one point from the data set you will not be sure that data point is an accurate measure of the average of the whole data set.

Standard Deviation is also commonly used to define how confident you can be with a statistical measurement. In a typical scientific experiment a result would only be considered statistically significant if it falls more than two Standard Deviations from the expected value (mean or average value). It can also be used to show confidence in the results of a poll, where two Standard Deviations are considered ~95% confidence that the results of the poll are likely to reflect the actual outcome.
